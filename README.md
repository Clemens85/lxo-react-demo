This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

The aim of this demo project is to show the usage of some recommended libraries / functions in the React ecosystem.

#### What's included

Show the usage of:
* React Router for navigation purposes
* React Hooks for state handling
* Fetch data using axios (when mounting components and on user actions)
* Using a custom hook for fetching data asynchronously
* Composing React components
* Date-fns as a library for handling date functionalities
* React-Hook-Form library for form handling
* YUP as frontend validation library (integrated into React-Hook-Form)
* React-Helmet for dynmaically rendering HTML titles for pages / routes
* react-testing-library for testing React components

#### What it is NOT

The examples are no real world examples by purpose and aren't necessarily to be considered 'Best Practice'.

Furthermore they are only a collection of recommended tools / techniques and don't replace an indepth documentation read.

Finally they are definitely not a good example of how to layout HTML/CSS. There are used only some very crude inline
CSS styles, instead of using some high sophisticated HTML/CSS tools/techniques. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
